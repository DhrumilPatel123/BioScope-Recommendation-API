# BioScope-Recommendation-API

- API Link : https://bioscope-api.herokuapp.com/movie?title=Inception

An open movie recommendation API that has been built using Python and deployed on Heroku. 
This API is based on the Content Based Filtering technique used in recommendation systems where we recommend items to an user based on the input item's attributes. We have more than 6000 movies present in our dataset and our recommendation algorithm works according to that.
Use the BioScope API and built your own website or app and recommend movie to your users accordingly.
